<p>Personally I am not a fan of dark mode in most cases. However sometimes I find myself reading a long article at night or switching from terminal to a page a lot. Not being a fan or installing firefox extensions I decided to see what could be done with a bookmarklet.</p>
<p>I think bookmarklets are great and am planning to use them for more custom scripts in the future.</p>
<p>After creating this and realizing a number of features such as persistance across page loads would not be possible. I realized how small this project is. Having chosen to use the colour <strong>#222</strong> I decided to name the project 222.</p>
<p>After seeing the bookmarklet was around 500 bytes uncompressed, I decided to take it on as a minifying challenge to see if I could drop that done to just <strong>222</strong> bytes. After a few unusual hacks I managed to acheive this which is cool and gives the project it’s name.</p>
