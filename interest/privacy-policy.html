        Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information.
        <p>
        <div class="title">
          Location Information
        </div>
        <p>
        We may determine the approximate location of your device from your IP address. We collect and use this information to, for example, calculate how many people visit our Services from certain geographic regions.
        </p>
        <div class="title">
         LocalStorage 
        </div>

        The site makes use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage" target="_blank">localStorage</a> used on the user machine. This is used to improve the user experience so that data is retained inbetween sessions. We do not store this data on our servers.

          How And Why We Use Information
        </div>
        <div class="title">
        Purposes for Using Information
        </div>
        <p>
        We use information about you as mentioned above and for the purposes listed below:
        To further develop and improve our Services for example by adding new features that we think our users will enjoy
        To monitor and analyze trends and better understand how users interact with our Services, which helps us improve our Services and make them easier to use
        To measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition for example, we may analyze the features used by those who continue to use our Services after a certain length of time;
        To monitor and prevent any problems with our Services and to protect the security of our Services
        </p>

        <div class="title big">
        Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
        </div>
        <p>
        A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that:

        <ol>
          <li>The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under our Terms of Service or other agreements with you</li>
          <li>The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation</li>
          <li>The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person</li>
          <li>We have a legitimate interest in using your information–for example, to provide and update our Services, to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising, and better understand user retention and attrition, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience</li>
          <li>You have given us your consent for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our Cookie Policy.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        We share information about you in the limited circumstances spelled out below and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy:
        </p>
        <p>
        Subsidiaries, Employees, and Independent Contractors: We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries, our employees, and individuals who are our independent contractors that need to know the information in order to help us provide our Services or to process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries, employees, and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for personal information that we share with them.
        </p>
        <p>        Third Party Vendors: We may share information about you with third party vendors who need to know information about you in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This group includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you, those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g. by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns), those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers), who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you.
        </p>
        <p>
        Legal Requests: We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.
        </p>
        <p>
        With Your Consent: We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties with which you authorise us to do so, such as the social media services that you share with through our share buttons
        </p>
        <p>
        Aggregated or De-Identified Information: We may share information that has been aggregated or reasonably de-identified, so that the information could not reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services and we may share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.
        </p>
        <p>        
        Published Support Requests: And if you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
        </p>

        <div class="title big">
        How Long We Keep Information
        </div>
        <p>
        We generally discard information about you when we no longer need the information for the purposes for which we collect and use it–which are described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information–and we are not legally required to continue to keep it.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, we keep the web server logs that record information about a visitor, such as the visitor’s IP address, browser type, and operating system, for approximately 30 days. We retain the logs for this period of time in order to, among other things, analyze traffic and investigate issues if something goes wrong.
        </p>

        <div class="title big">
        Security
        </div>
        <p>
        While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so, such as monitoring our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
